DAMeasy (Digital Asset Management made easy)

DAMEeasy.pl 

I developed the DAMeasy package as part of a photography workflow to rapidly publish search engine optimized web pages as an online gallery from a simple upload of an image.

The DAMeasy script runs on a webserver and runs as a CRON to examine to a defined directory of images for any additions, deletions and changes.

For any new new image, a search engine optimized webpage is built from a template with data from the image EXIF data (keywords, description, GPS data, etc)

A PHP script creates a dynamic KML file for google maps to display the images on a Google Map

This script was used for work I did for Denali National Park to photograph the Alaska Range from the air
